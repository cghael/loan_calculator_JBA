Project from JetBrains Academy - Track: Python for Beginners

## About
Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!

## Learning outcomes
You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.
